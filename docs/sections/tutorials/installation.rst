Installing PhysioZoo
====================

The PhysioZoo user interface (``PZ-UI``) can be run from Matlab or be installed as a standalone application. If you do not need the graphic user interface then you can directly download the HRV source code (``mhrv`` library). ``PZ-UI`` and ``mhrv`` were tested for Matlab 2016a and above running on Windows.

1. Clone the [repo](https://) or download the source code,

2. From Matlab, run the `mhrv_init` function from the root of the repo to setup.

More information on the ``mhrv`` library is available [here](https://).

1)	Download the source code,

2)	From MATLAB launch PhysioZoo by running the script "PhysioZoo.m"

.. Note:: The ``PZ-UI`` user interface has two modules: a ``Peak detection`` (used to process electrophysiological signals and obtain the RR time series) module and a ``HRV analysis`` module (used to process the RR time series and compute HRV measures).

After downloading the software ([here](https://)) click the “physiozoo.exe” file. This will start the installation process. You can then go through the following steps.

.. note:: Some of the screen might be slightly different depending on the version of Windows you are using and whether you already have the MATLAB runtime compiler installed. If Matlab runtime compiler is not installed then it will be done through this process but the installation might take some time.


1)	If you get the following screen displayed then click “Run”
